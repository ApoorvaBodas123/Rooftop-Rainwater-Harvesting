# Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting Project

A comprehensive web application designed to help users plan, analyze, and implement rooftop rainwater harvesting systems. This project includes both frontend and backend components to provide a complete solution for water conservation.

## 🌟 Features

- **Rooftop Area Analysis**: Calculate potential water collection based on rooftop dimensions and local rainfall data
- **System Design Recommendations**: Get customized recommendations for rainwater harvesting system components
- **Water Savings Calculator**: Estimate potential water and cost savings
- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize rainfall data and water collection potential
- **User Accounts**: Save and manage multiple property assessments

## 🚀 Tech Stack
