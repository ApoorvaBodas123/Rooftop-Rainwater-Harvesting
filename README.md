# 🌧️ Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting Project

A comprehensive web application designed to help users plan, analyze, and implement rooftop rainwater harvesting systems. This project includes both frontend and backend components to provide a complete solution for water conservation.

## 🌟 Features

- **Rooftop Area Analysis**: Calculate potential water collection based on rooftop dimensions and local rainfall data
- **System Design Recommendations**: Get customized recommendations for rainwater harvesting system components
- **Water Savings Calculator**: Estimate potential water and cost savings
- **Interactive Maps**: Visualize rainfall data and water collection potential
- **User Accounts**: Save and manage multiple property assessments

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript
- Material-UI for responsive UI components
- Redux for state management
- Leaflet.js for interactive maps
- Chart.js for data visualization

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB for data storage
- JWT for authentication
- RESTful API architecture

## 🛠️ Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher) or yarn
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- Git

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rooftop-Rainwater-Harvesting.git
cd Rooftop-Rainwater-Harvesting
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   # yarn install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file and update the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Start the backend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   # yarn dev
   ```
   
   The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   # yarn install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   # yarn dev
   ```
   
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend Configuration
- The backend requires a running MongoDB instance. You can use MongoDB Atlas (cloud) or run it locally.
- Update the `.env` file with your MongoDB connection string and other environment-specific settings.

### Frontend Configuration
- The frontend is configured to connect to `http://localhost:5000` by default.
- To change the API endpoint, update the `VITE_API_URL` in the `.env` file in the frontend directory.
